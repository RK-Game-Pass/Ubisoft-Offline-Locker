## How It Works

The software modifies the **Windows Firewall rules** to either block or allow internet access for `UplayWebCore.exe`, which is the core network component of Ubisoft Connect. It creates **both inbound and outbound rules** to ensure complete disconnection when blocking.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 / 11
- Python 3.x (for manual build)
- `pyinstaller` (for EXE generation)

## Installation

### üîπ Using Prebuilt EXE

1. Download `UbisoftOfflineLocker.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/RK-Game-Pass/UbisoftOfflineLocker/releases) page.
2. Run it **as Administrator** (Right-click ‚Üí "Run as administrator").
3. Select the **`UplayWebCore.exe`** file from the Ubisoft Connect installation folder.
4. Click **"Block connection"** to disable online access.
5. Click **"Allow connection"** to restore internet access.

### üîπ Building from Source

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/RK-Game-Pass/UbisoftOfflineLocker.git
   cd UbisoftOfflineLocker
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```
3. **Build the executable:**
   ```sh
   pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico --name=UbisoftOfflineLocker --uac-admin main.py
   ```
4. The compiled `.exe` file will be in the `dist/` folder.

   ```
3. If a path has already been saved, it will be pre-filled automatically.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Blocking Ubisoft Connect‚Äôs Internet Access**
- Click **"Block connection"**  
- This creates **Windows Firewall rules** to **block all inbound and outbound traffic**.  
- **Use Case:**  
  ‚úÖ You want to force Ubisoft Connect into **offline mode**.  
  ‚úÖ You want to prevent updates or online authentication while keeping your games playable.  

üö® **IMPORTANT:** After blocking the connection, Ubisoft Connect **must be restarted**. Even if offline mode appears active, you still need to **restart the launcher and log in again**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Restoring Ubisoft Connect‚Äôs Internet Access**

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Checking Firewall Rules**
If you want to verify that the firewall rules were applied, run the following command in the **Command Prompt** (`cmd`):  
```sh
netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all
```

## Troubleshooting

- **"Firewall modification failed. Try running as administrator."**  
  ‚Üí Right-click on `UbisoftOfflineLocker.exe` and select **"Run as Administrator"**.

  ‚Üí Ensure you selected `UplayWebCore.exe` from the correct installation folder.
